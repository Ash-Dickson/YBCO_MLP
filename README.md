# YBCO_MLP
A collection of machine learned potentials for YBCO, trained using ACE, MACE, GAP and tabGAP. All potentials were trained on the same database. The CP2K input used to collect the training data is included. All simulations were performed with CP2K version 2024.1.

Downloading the potential files can either be done by downloading the raw data directly from github, or by cloning the repository. To clone the repository you must first have git lfs installed:

```
git lfs install
```

Then simply use ```git clone --recursive GIT_URL_HERE```.
